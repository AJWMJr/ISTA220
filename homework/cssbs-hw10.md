1. they take up one contiguous block of memory on the heap

2. the heap

3. on the stack

4. the type declaration to the left of the brackets

5. (initialize a variable; use variable in operation. do block as long as this evauluates to true; increment your variable)

6. by iterating through one array and copying its contents one index at a time.

7. an array of arrays has two brackets next to their type. in a multi-dimensional array each comma seperated number specifies the length of a dimension (which are usually all the same), while in an array of arrays each element is assigned an array of a specified length individually

8. how specific your requirements are for the given array and what relation your elements have to one another

9. create a for loop that iterates through the multidimensional array and assigns its values 1 by 1 to a new flat array

10. If youâ€™ve assigned a variable outside and re-use it within the forEach, the outside variable retains its value.
